# Cellular-Automata-Virtual-Ants

This is a University project, the intention is to test how different forms of comunication affect the ability
of cellular automata to form stable structures. 

The final product should be a program that runs in the Unity engine and allows users to toggle certain rules 
to see how the behaviour is affected. The main inspiration for this project is Conways 'Game Of Life'.

My plan is to first impliment a simple version of GOL in P5.js, then re-impliment this in Unity. 
This way I can test ideas in a form I am more comfortable with.
