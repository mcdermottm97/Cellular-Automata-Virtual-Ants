# Cellular-Automata-Virtual-Ants

In this university project the intention is to test how different forms of interaction affect the ability of cellular automata to form complex patterns. This product was designed to investigate the question "To what extent does interaction between virtual agents affect their ability to perform complex tasks?" by varying the neighbourhood size of Virtual Ants.

The program runs on the P5.js framework and was written to be used in the VSCode editor, making use of the 'P5.vscode' extension and its included 'Live Server' extensions.

The product can be launched from VSCode by having the product folder selected in the workspace and clicking the 'Go Live' button on the status bar, this should open the program in your browser.  

If for any reason the project does not launch properly please check both extension are enabled as well as checking the 'P5.min.js' and 'P5.sound.min.js' are present in the library folder and contain the libraries (it should look like a lot of unreadable code). if the libraries are not present please follow the instructions given on the 'P5.vscode' extension.
